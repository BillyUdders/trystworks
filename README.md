# Trystworks

Making a reactive app with webflux and MongoDB to whet my appetite and stave off the Java border. Build is strictly _works on my machine_. You will need to run MongoDB on local. 
I have the gubbins for a heroku deploy in this as well. Should build and run with Gradle, on localhost:5000.
